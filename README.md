**CQ Rush** is a free, open-source, donationware-suggested web app for **ARRL Field Day** contest logging. React frontend, Node.js/Express API, and PostgreSQL. Each club or operator configures their own entry name in the admin panel — the app brand is always CQ Rush.

Branding assets live in `client/public/branding/` (icon, white icon, logo, banner, donation QR).

## Features

### Logging

- Log QSOs with callsign, band, mode, class, ARRL section/location, and notes
- Callsign lookup via server proxy — **Callook.info** for FCC licenses, plus **1×1 special event** callsigns (e.g. `K6T`) from [1x1callsigns.org](https://1x1callsigns.org/index.php/search-1x1-database) with holder location enrichment
- Duplicate-entry detection and field validation (class, location, band, mode)
- Real-time multi-operator coordination with band/mode conflict flags

### Scoring & maps

- Field Day score breakdown (Phone / CW / Digital) and projected score from station settings
- Interactive ARRL section map (county-level boundaries, contacted sections highlighted)
- Public display at `/display` — score, operators, recent contacts, and full map (polls every 5s, dark/light mode)

### Admin

- Logbook management with inline edit, soft delete, restore, and edit history
- Station settings (entry class, location, power, bonuses)
- **Log export** (Admin → Export Logs) — see [Log export formats](#log-export-formats) below
- Security & branding: club name, shared site password, or per-operator accounts (callsign + password + admin flag)

### Authentication

Two modes (configured in **Admin → Security & Branding**):


| Mode                             | Login                                                          | Admin access            |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Shared site password**         | Single password for the site; optional separate admin password | Admin password when set |
| **Individual operator accounts** | Callsign + password per user                                   | Per-user admin checkbox |


No login is required until you enable site security or add operator accounts. The public display route (`/display`) bypasses site login.

## Log export formats

From **Admin → Export Logs**, CQ Rush generates contest and logbook files from your active QSOs and station settings:

| Format | File | Use for |
| ------ | ---- | ------- |
| **Cabrillo** | `{callsign}.log` | Official ARRL Field Day entry — attach as dupe-sheet documentation at [field-day.arrl.org](https://field-day.arrl.org/fdentry.php) |
| **ADIF** | `{callsign}.adi` | **LoTW** — sign with [TrustedQSL (TQSL)](https://lotw.arrl.org/lotw-help/sgnupload/) to produce a `.TQ8`, then upload; **QRZ Logbook** — import ADIF directly |

The export panel also includes:

- **Copy Full Summary** — Field Day entry fields (call used, section, class, exchange, claimed score, QSO totals, operators, bonuses) for pasting into the ARRL web form
- **Open ARRL Entry Form**, **Open LoTW Upload**, and **Open QRZ Logbook** shortcuts

Validation runs before download (station callsign, section, class, and active contacts required). Cabrillo is accepted in place of a dupe sheet but does **not** replace the official ARRL summary form.

## Pi Display add-in

The **[PI_Display](./PI_Display/)** add-in turns a **Raspberry Pi Zero W / Zero 2 W** into a dedicated kiosk for the public **`/display`** page (score, operators, recent contacts, map — same 5s polling as a browser tab).

| Mode | What happens |
| ---- | -------------- |
| **First boot** | Pi creates Wi‑Fi hotspot **CQ-Rush-Display** (password `cqrush-setup`) |
| **Setup portal** | Connect from a phone/laptop → `http://10.42.0.1:8080` → scan Wi‑Fi, set display URL (must include `/display`) |
| **Display mode** | Pi joins your network and opens Chromium fullscreen on that URL |

**Install options:**

1. **Flash a pre-built image** (Linux host, pi-gen) — `cd PI_Display && sudo ./build-image.sh` → flash `PI_Display/build/cqrush-display-pi.img`
2. **Install on existing Pi OS** — `sudo ./PI_Display/install-on-device.sh`

Full hardware list, re-enter setup mode, config file paths, and systemd logs: **[PI_Display/README.md](./PI_Display/README.md)**.

This add-in is **git-only** (not deployed to AWS). You can run the logger on one Pi (`deploy/pi/setup.sh`) and point the display at `http://localhost:3002/display`, or use a second Pi as the screen.

## Quick Start (Development)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 16 (or Docker — see below)

### Setup

```bash
# Database (Docker)
docker compose up db -d

# Server
cd server
cp .env.example .env          # edit DATABASE_URL if needed
npm install
npx prisma migrate deploy --schema=../prisma/schema.prisma
npm run seed
npm run dev                   # http://localhost:3002

# Client (separate terminal)
cd client
npm install
npm start                     # http://localhost:3000 (proxied to API)
```

On first launch, open **Admin** and set your club name, Field Day entry, and security preferences.

### Production-like local test (Docker)

```bash
docker compose up --build
# Open http://localhost:3002
```

## AWS Deployment

See [DEPLOY_AWS.md](./DEPLOY_AWS.md) for EC2 + Docker Compose deployment.

```bash
cd deploy/aws
./launch.sh    # First time — EC2 instance
./deploy.sh    # Push updates and restart containers
```

Password reset and auth CLI: `./deploy/aws/reset-passwords.sh --help`

## Raspberry Pi Deployment

Run on a local network with Docker on a **Pi 4/5** (ARM64). See [DEPLOY_RASPBERRY_PI.md](./DEPLOY_RASPBERRY_PI.md) for full instructions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RandomActsofFrank/CQ_Rush.git
cd CQ_Rush
chmod +x deploy/pi/setup.sh deploy/pi/update.sh
./deploy/pi/setup.sh          # First time — generates secrets, builds containers
./deploy/pi/update.sh         # Pull updates and rebuild
```

First Docker build on a Pi can take **20–40 minutes**. The logger will be at `http://<pi-ip>:3002` (public display at `/display`).

## Upgrading (v1.0 → v1.3 and future releases)

CQ Rush is designed for **in-place upgrades**. Your QSO log, operator accounts, passwords, club name, and station settings are stored in **PostgreSQL** on a Docker volume (`hamlog_pg_data`). Normal upgrade scripts **do not** delete that volume.

Every time the app container starts, it runs:

1. **`prisma migrate deploy`** — applies any new SQL migrations in order (safe to run repeatedly)
2. **`node seed.js`** — ensures default config rows exist (does not wipe contacts)
3. **`node index.js`** — starts the API

You can skip intermediate versions (for example **1.0 → 1.3** directly). Migrations run sequentially; existing data is preserved and backfilled where needed (v1.3 assigns all existing QSOs to the **`field-day`** contest slug and copies legacy station settings into the new `contests` table).

### Recommended before upgrading

1. **Use a git clone** for installs you plan to maintain — `./deploy/pi/update.sh` and `./deploy/aws/deploy.sh` expect to sync from a repo checkout. A one-time ZIP download works for first install, but git makes upgrades much simpler.
2. **Optional backup** (especially before Field Day if you already have a log):

```bash
# On the server or Pi, from the project directory (adjust env file path if needed)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file deploy/aws/.env.production \
  exec -T db sh -c 'pg_dump -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB"' > "cq-rush-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql"
```

3. Expect **1–3 minutes of downtime** while containers rebuild and migrations run.

### Upgrade on AWS EC2

From your laptop (same machine you used for the original deploy):

```bash
cd /path/to/CQ_Rush
git fetch --tags
git checkout v1.3.0          # or: git pull origin main

cd deploy/aws
./start.sh                   # if the instance was stopped
./deploy.sh                  # syncs code, rebuilds containers, runs migrations
```

Your `.env.production` on the server is **not** overwritten by rsync (secrets stay put). Hard-refresh the browser (Cmd+Shift+R) after deploy.

### Upgrade on Raspberry Pi

On the Pi:

```bash
cd ~/CQ_Rush
git fetch --tags
git checkout v1.3.0          # or: git pull origin main
./deploy/pi/update.sh
```

### Upgrade with Docker only (no deploy scripts)

```bash
git fetch --tags
git checkout v1.3.0
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file deploy/aws/.env.production up -d --build
```

Do **not** run `docker compose down -v` — the `-v` flag removes volumes and would delete your database.

### After upgrading

1. Open the logbook and confirm your contacts appear in **Admin → Logbook**.
2. Open **Admin → Station Settings** — entry class, section, and bonuses should match what you had before (v1.3 stores these per contest under slug **`field-day`**).
3. If anything looks wrong, restore from your optional SQL backup or contact support via GitHub issues.

### Future releases

Same pattern: fetch the new tag (or pull `main`), run **`./deploy/aws/deploy.sh`** or **`./deploy/pi/update.sh`**, hard-refresh browsers. See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for breaking changes (rare; called out per release).

## External Data Sources & APIs

The app uses a small set of third-party services at runtime. Everything else (Field Day rules, ARRL section boundaries, county map geometry) is bundled or computed locally.

### Third-party services (online)

| **[1x1callsigns.org](https://1x1callsigns.org/index.php/search-1x1-database)** | `https://www.1x1callsigns.org/1x1search.php?callsign={CALL}` | FCC 1×1 special event reservations (event name, holder callsign, dates) | Server (1×1 callsigns, e.g. `K6T`) | None; HTML scrape of W5YI database                  |
| **[Nominatim](https://nominatim.org)** (OpenStreetMap)             | `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse`        | City/state from grid-square coordinates when Callook returns a grid | Server (during callsign lookup)      | None; sends `User-Agent: HamRadioContestLogger/1.0` |
| **[OpenStreetMap tiles](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)** | `https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png` | Basemap in the callsign detail popup (Leaflet)                      | Browser (`App.js`)                   | None                                                |


**Callsign lookup flow:** Browser → `GET /api/lookup/:callsign` → for **1×1 format** callsigns (`K`/`N`/`W` + digit + letter, e.g. `W5T`), check the **local 1×1 cache** first, then live [1x1callsigns.org](https://1x1callsigns.org/index.php/search-1x1-database); operator **name** and **grid** come from the requestor call via Callook; otherwise Callook → (optional) Nominatim reverse geocode → JSON to client. Successful lookups are cached in PostgreSQL (`callsign_lookups`).

Admins can refresh reservations for a **date range** from **Admin → Station Settings → 1×1 Special Event Cache** (`POST /api/one-by-one/cache/refresh` with `startDate` and `endDate`). The server queries `1x1search.php?startd=…&endd=…`, then downloads each reservation’s detail page (`?byid=…`) and enriches requestor calls via Callook. Reservations are stored in `one_by_one_reservations`.

Override the 1×1 search base URL with `ONE_BY_ONE_SEARCH_URL` if needed. Tune detail download pacing with `ONE_BY_ONE_REQUEST_DELAY_MS` (default 150) and `ONE_BY_ONE_DETAIL_CONCURRENCY` (default 3).

Raw Census shapefiles for rebuilding map assets live under `data/geographic/`. Regenerate Canadian section GeoJSON with `node scripts/build-canada-section-geojson.js` (requires `shapefile` dev dependency).

### Operational notes

- **No API keys** are required for Callook, Nominatim, or OSM tiles.
- **Nominatim** is a shared public service — avoid excessive lookup volume; results are cached server-side after the first lookup per callsign.
- **Outbound HTTPS** from the server is required for callsign lookup (Callook + Nominatim). The browser needs access to OSM tile servers for the popup map.
- Set `**APP_URL`** in production to your public site URL (e.g. `https://logger.yourclub.org`) for CORS and secure session cookies. Set `**COOKIE_SECURE=true`** when using HTTPS.

## API Overview

All routes are on the same origin as the web app (e.g. `/api/...`). The React client uses `fetch` with cookies (`credentials: 'include'`) via `client/src/api.js` and `apiFetch()` elsewhere.

**Public read (no site auth):** `GET /api/auth/status`, `GET /api/contacts`, `GET /api/active-operators`, `GET /api/station-settings`, `GET /api/lookup/:callsign`

**Auth routes (no prior session required):** `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/logout`, `POST /api/auth/admin/login`, etc.

When site login is enabled, other mutating `/api/`* routes require an authenticated session.
